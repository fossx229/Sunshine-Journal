# Sunshine Journal by Team README.md
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UMM-CSci-3601-S18/iteration-4-readme-md.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UMM-CSci-3601-S18/iteration-4-readme-md)

## Introduction
Our team's main goal was to develop a web application that provides clients of mental health practitioners a service 
to use when physical appointments are not available. This web app will assist in handling crisis situations as well as 
the ability for mental health practitioners to review their clients emotions since the last time they met. It is designed in a way
to be both easy for the clients to use, and the mental health practitioners to analyze.
